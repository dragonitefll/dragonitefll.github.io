EDITING RULES
------
1. In every single page you make, make sure to write in the beginning these 4 lines:

<pre>---
layout: a
title: [whatevertitleyouwant]
---</pre>

2. Do not touch anyone else's page.
3. After the 4 lines, put whatever you like. You do not need to put `<html>`,`<body>`, etc.


STUFF YOU CAN USE
---
Here are some stuff you can use in your page. I have included it in the layout so that you can access the stuff from every page.
- Bootstrap
- w3.CSS
- jQuery
- MathJax
- Angular.JS
- Font Awesome/Material Icons-- these allow you to make cool icons on your pages!
You can study all of these on [w3schools](http://w3schools.com)
